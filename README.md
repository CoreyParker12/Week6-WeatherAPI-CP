# Week6-WeatherAPI-CP
This is Corey Parker's week 6 homework, Weather API.

This project uses Open Weather's weather API to allow the user to input the city of their choice and return the current weather and a 5 day forecast. Additionally, their previous searches are saved to local storage so that they can select the city again to see its weather.

My biggest struggles/achievements were:

1. Getting the button click for the saved cities to work.

2. Keeping track of variables and names was challening this time as it is such a large js file.

3. I'm really enjoying creating larger and larger projects though.
